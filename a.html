<p>About Jammu :</p>
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro'; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
<p>Jammu and Kashmir is the northern Union Territory of India, situated amidst the Himalayan Mountains. The UT has unique geographical, climatic, and environmental characters and natural features like rivers, lakes, glaciers, plateaus, and valleys. Jammu and Srinagar are the two capital cities of JK UT, where Srinagar is the summer capital and Jammu is the winter capital. The city of Jammu is also known as the "City of Temples." It is believed that Raja Jamboo Lochan originally founded the city in the 14th century B.C., which eventually came to be known as "Jamboo" after his name. The name was later pronounced Jammu. During the last decade, a large influx of pilgrims to the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine and the Shri Amarnath shrine has opened many tourism and economic options in the Jammu province. It has also added dynamism to this province, which necessitates the channelization of urban growth in many districts of Jammu province.</p><p>
Jammu is located at 74⁰ 24' and 75⁰ 18' east longitude and 32⁰ 50' and 33⁰ 30' north latitude. It is situated on the bank of the River Tawi. Jammu city is at an elevation of 1,030 feet above sea level. It is located on National Highway 44 to the northwest of Delhi. Due to its location, Jammu has assumed importance as a transit place, as it is located at the vertex of linkage corridors to Rajouri, Poonch, Kishtwar and Doda and serves as the gateway to the Kashmir Valley, Ladakh and the pilgrimage sites of Sh. Mata Vaishno Devi (Katra) and Shri Amarnath shrine (Pahalgam).

The Jammu division, which includes the districts of Jammu, Kathua, Samba, Udhampur, Reasi, Rajouri, Poonch, Ramban, Doda, and Kishtwar, is separated from the Kashmir division by a low-altitude Himalayan range of 26,293 km2.The Ravi-Tawi Kandi plains, Shiwaliks, Pir Panjal belt, Chenab Valley, Bhaderwah Valley, Gandoh Valley, Paddar Valley, and Warwan-Marwah Valley are all geographical sub-regions of Jammu.Six districts of the Jammu region fall under the Chenab Valley and Pir Panjal Himalayas, whereas four districts are in the Ravi-Tawi region. During Maharaja Gulab Singh’s reign, the Bhimber, Kotli, Mirpur, Poonch (western parts), Haveli, Bagh and Sudhnati districts were also part of the Jammu region, but now they are part of Pakistan-administered Jammu and Kashmir. Dogra rule started in 1846 with Maharaja Gulab Singh as the first ruler of the Dogra dynasty. The Jammu city transformed from a mediaeval character to a feudal system with the seat of the government at the highest commanding point, nobles lying in close proximity to the palace, the Agora, and the market place at the center, and the lowest class of society towards the outskirts. Maharaja Ranbir Singh (1857-1885 A.D.) contributed to the construction of temple complexes throughout the city, which still dominate the city structure as a whole, and Jammu is remembered as the city of temples.The growth of Jammu city has attained new heights since the period 1885–1925 A.D. The famous Tawi Bridge, Mission House, Ranbir Public Library, Mission School, Military Hospital, Prince of Wales College (now G.G.M. College), Dak Bungalow at Residency Road, Silk Factory, Sardar Hospital, S.R.M.P. High School,and Leper Asylum are major contributions of Maharaja Pratap Singh’s dynasty.
Jammu province is not behind as far as the self-reliant campaign is concerned. Atamnirbhar Jammu is based on the economic resources of the Jammu Division. The economy of Jammu province is based on four major contributors: the agriculture sector, Jammu tourism, horticulture, floriculture, and minerals from Jammu. Agriculture in Jammu division produces export-quality basmati rice, world-famous pahari (Bhaderwah) kidney beans, Kishtwari saffron, Gucchi mushrooms from Doda, etc. This website provides an in-depth look at the self-sufficient Jammu Division of the JK UT.
